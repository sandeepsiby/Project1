# Daily Habit Tracker

## Abstract

This project involves designing and developing a **Daily Habit Tracker**
web application. The tracker allows users to add and edit daily habits
such as "Exercise," "Read," or "Drink Water" and visually track their
progress. The system includes features like a daily tracker grid, streak
counter, progress indicators, and reset options. Built with **HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery**, the project emphasizes clean UI,
responsive design, and intuitive user interaction to help users stay
consistent with their habits.

## Objectives

-   Design a user-friendly interface for managing daily habits.\
-   Implement a daily tracker grid with checkboxes or colored cells.\
-   Add functionality for streak counting and progress tracking.\
-   Provide reset options for clearing all tracking data.\
-   Ensure responsiveness across devices using Bootstrap and CSS.

## Scope of the Project

-   Focused on **front-end development** with HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap,
    and jQuery.\
-   Provides habit tracking, streak monitoring, and visual progress
    indicators.\
-   No server-side integration (data is reset on page refresh unless
    extended).\
-   Designed for accessibility and usability across desktop, tablet, and
    mobile devices.

## Outcome

-   Successfully developed a responsive **Daily Habit Tracker**.\
-   Provided habit management features with progress visualization.\
-   Improved knowledge of **JavaScript interactivity and Bootstrap
    responsiveness**.\
-   Learned how to balance functionality with clean, minimal design.

## Future Enhancements

-   Store data using **localStorage or a backend database**.\
-   Add **user authentication** for personalized tracking.\
-   Provide **data visualization** (charts/graphs of progress).\

## Conclusion

This project successfully implements a **Daily Habit Tracker** that
helps users monitor and build habits effectively. By combining **HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery**, we created an intuitive and
visually appealing interface. The project enhanced our skills in
responsive web design, interactivity, and UI/UX design principles.
Future enhancements like storage, charts, and notifications can further
improve its usability.
